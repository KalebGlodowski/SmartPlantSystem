# Kaleb's Plant System

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to automate plant watering and track environmental factors within the vacinity of the plant system.

1. Turn the water pump on when the soil sensor detects a certain dryness level.

1. Detect the environmental factors of the room.
		-Temperature
		-Humidity
		-Pressure
		-Dust
		-Air Quality

1. CAD Designs
		-Create a smart flower pot
		-Create a water tank for the pumps
		-Create a stand that holds the breadboard, sensors, flower pot, and water tank.

1. Create a dashboard that enterfaces with all of the environmental factors and encorporate buttons for manual watering.

### The controller will have a dashboard displaying all sensor information via graphs and can take manual input to control the water pump.
